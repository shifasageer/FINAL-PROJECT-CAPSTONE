Problem Statement 10: Scenario: In todayâ€™s urban environments, personal safety and well-being are increasingly becoming major concerns, particularly for those who live or work in high-risk areas. Individuals may feel vulnerable to threats like crime, harassment, or accidents, and often lack the tools needed to effectively protect themselves or respond to emergencies. Moreover, the stresses of daily life, coupled with concerns for personal safety, can take a toll on mental and emotional well-being. While there are various apps available for tracking safety or providing mental health support, few offer a comprehensive solution that integrates both aspects in a user-friendly manner. The need for a reliable, all-in-one solution that addresses both safety and well-being has never been greater, especially in a world where individuals are more mobile and exposed to various risks.
